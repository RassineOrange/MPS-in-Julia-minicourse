# MPS-in-Julia-minicourse
Material for a minicourse of (uniform) matrix product states, implemented in Julia.
The course takes/took place in the Perimeter Institute in Fall 2017.
Credit for much of the material belongs to Ash Milsted (https://github.com/amilsted) and Guifre Vidal.

Section 1 is a good to the whole concept of tensor networks and the graphical notation.
Section 3 talks about MPS, and covers some of the things we have covered and will cover, in addition to stuff we wont' talk about in this course.
